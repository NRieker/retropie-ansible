# retropie-automation

## Summary

This project's purpose is to add pre and post-configuration automation to a Raspberry Pi running RetroPie using Ansible in an infrastructure-as-code manner.

## Why

The [RetroPie](https://github.com/RetroPie) team has done an incredible job of creating a simple process to setup multiple emulators on a Raspberry Pi. They've also created pre-built images which simply the setup even further. This project adds additional post-configuration automation such as joystick configurations, cloud saves, etc. Plus, Ansible is awesome!
